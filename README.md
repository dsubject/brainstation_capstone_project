Welcome to my capstone project. This was the final project that I presented before graduating from BrainStation's full stack web development program.

For those who don't already know, I'm a beekeeper outside of my life as a coder. For my final project, I wanted to make something that I would use for a purpose that I was passionate about, so I decided to go for a beekeeping app.

As a beekeeper, we regularly go into our apiary to perform hive inspections. This usually involves a pen and paper (or your "Notes" app on your iPhone) and consists of checklists and notes that are made for each individual hive.

The app that I built allows the user to create new hives and store hive inspection checklists for each hive. It also includes a section for "seasonal notes", which serve as seasonal reminders of tasks that should be performed (ie) checking for diseases, harvesting honey, doing treatments. Finally, I included a weather component that would use a weather api to check today's weather and return an image and personal message that would tell the user if today is a good day to beekeep or not.

I have not updated this app since its creation, so I'm not sure if it still builds, but please feel free to look through the source code and check it out. There's some pretty good stuff in there â€” function names and commit messages that clearly indicate how flustered I was at the time teaching myself React Native and also trying to build a presentable final project. In the end, it all worked out, and I would do it all over again if I could.
